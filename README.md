# dotfiles

This is a repository containing all of my configurations of my current rice.
I use GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles (for a tutorial, [click here]( https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)).
Simply use Stow on all the folders in this repository (except for the screenshots folder).
